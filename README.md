## About the Project

AccountFirmPro was developed specifically for the accounting firm Shukron Bak & Senior, where my aunt is one of the managers. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and efficient management system for their operations. I have scheduled a meeting with the firm's managers to present the project and gather additional requirements before deploying it to the cloud for regular use by all clients and employees of the firm.
